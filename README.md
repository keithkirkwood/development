# Development

Template project for development work:

* VSCode workspace setup for Git, Python and Docker
* Configured with npm packages for ESLint, Prettier, and MarkdownLint
* Removed vale as this is not strictly required for development

## Usage

Take this as a template into a new project, then clone and run `npm install` in the local directory.
